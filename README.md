# Dental Clinic Database Management System

## Overview
This project is a **Dental Clinic Database Management System** designed to model the real-world operations of a dental clinic using a structured and scalable relational database.

The goal was to build a system that cleanly manages patient records, appointments, treatments, billing, and clinic staff while following best practices in database design, normalization, and querying.

This project focuses on turning a practical healthcare workflow into a well-organized, efficient database that could realistically support a small to medium-sized clinic.

---

## What This System Does
- Stores and manages patient and dentist information
- Tracks appointments and treatment history
- Handles billing and payment records
- Organizes prescriptions and clinic staff data
- Provides clean, readable reports using SQL queries and views

---

## Database Design
The database was designed from the ground up, starting with requirements analysis and ER modeling, followed by schema creation and normalization.

Key design goals:
- Avoid redundant data
- Maintain data integrity
- Support meaningful queries and reports
- Reflect real clinic workflows

All tables were normalized to **3NF and BCNF** to ensure consistency and scalability.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Oracle SQL**
- **Unix Shell Scripting**
- Relational Database Design
- ER / EER Modeling
- Functional Dependencies & Normalization
- SQL Views and Advanced Queries

---

## Features Implemented
- Fully implemented relational schema
- Realistic sample data for testing
- Advanced SQL queries using joins, aggregation, and subqueries
- SQL Views for simplified access to complex data
- Menu-driven Unix shell interface to execute database operations

---

## Why I Built This
I wanted to strengthen my database design skills by building something practical and realistic. A dental clinic system touches many common database challenges such as relationships, constraints, reporting, and normalization, making it a great case study for real-world DBMS design.

## Possible Improvements
- Web or desktop frontend for clinic staff
- Role-based access (admin, dentist, receptionist)
- Stored procedures, triggers, and indexing
- Analytics dashboards for clinic performance
